# Food Roulette

Bored and not sure what to eat? Food Roulette is a fun way to discover new foods around you. First specify a few options like maximum distance, cuisine type, or dietary restrictions. Then click "Pick For Me" and let the app do its magic! Enjoy your culinary adventure!

## History

About 5 years ago I put together a fun little side project called [Goto.Pizza](https://github.com/github-bdem/goto.pizza)

However due to life and work getting in the way, the site eventually became outdated. Once I found out that my beloved side project was no longer working I decided to not just re-do the project but instead update it and add more functionality so that you aren't just stuck with looking for one type of food only.

## Built Using

- [New Google Maps Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/nearby-search)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
